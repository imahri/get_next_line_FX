## üí°  About the project
-	This projects is about creating a function that, allows to read a line ending with a newline character ('\n') from a **file descriptor**, without knowing its size beforehand.
One of the goal of this project is to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: 
	-	**static variables**, and to gain a deeper understanding of **allocations**, whether they happen on the stack memory or in the heap memory, the manipulation and the life cycle of a **buffer**, the unexpected complexity implied in the use of one or many static variables.
	-	You will understand how files are opened, read and closed in an OS.
### Function Prototype
    
    char *get_next_line(int fd);
## üõ†Ô∏è  Usage
### Requirements  
The function is written in C language and thus needs the  **`gcc`  compiler**  and some standard  **C libraries**  to run.

### For mandatory

    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -D BUFFER_SIZE=xx get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c && ./a.out
### For bonus

    gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -D BUFFER_SIZE=xx get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c && ./a.out
